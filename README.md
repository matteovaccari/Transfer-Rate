Transfer Rate is a software that allows you to easily manage your finances, with a quick look at each of your accounts (current, savings, pro).


You can select an account via the top buttons, and make an expense or a deposit.


(Don't forget to save regularly)


The transaction history displays the latest transactions for the selected account.


When you click on the "End of month" button, it enters the value of the current account balance in the middle list.


This allows you to view all your current account balances at the end of each month.
